This is a project comparing the performance of SVM classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors for Semantic Analysis on a collection of tweets.

This is a more or less basic tutorial on succesfully performing Sentiment Analysis on simple datasets consisting of sentences as in comments or tweets.

As mentioned, we use a collection of Tweets and peform the following operations in the following order:
  1. Install packages required for text mining, analysis and visualization
  2. Load and explore the dataset
  3. Construct a corpus
  4. Clean the text
  5. Evaluate Term Frequency
  6. Perform Dimension Reduction
  7. Inspect word distribution within topics
  8. Train classifiers
  9. Cross-validate and compare model performances

Upon completion of this project, one can expect to be able to perform an end-to-end project in R.
